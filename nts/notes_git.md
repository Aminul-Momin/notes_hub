üî• KEY WORDS:

-   Checkout
    -   Checkout: Switching between different commit, branches or tags.
    -   Checkout a Branch means changing Head Pointer from current branch to the branch to be checkedout.
-   Initial Commit
-   Untracked File
-   HEAD:
    -   `HEAD`: Git‚Äôs way of referring to the current snapshot. Internally, the ‚Äògit checkout‚Äô command simply updates the HEAD to point to either the specified branch or commit. When it points to a branch, Git doesn‚Äôt complain, but when you check out a commit, it switches into a ‚Äúdetached HEAD‚Äù state.
    -   Head Pointer always points to the Active Branch. When it points to a branch, Git doesn‚Äôt complain, but when you check out a commit, it switches into a ‚Äúdetached HEAD‚Äù state.
    -   Detached Head
-   TAG:

    -   Tag is an extra lebel for a commit in the commit chain that can indicate usefull informations. A tag is not updated by the commit command.
    -   Annoted Tag
    -   Lightwaight Tag

-   `Remote`:

    -   In Git, a `remote` typically refers to a repository that is hosted on a separate server or location from your local repository. `Remote`s allow you to connect and interact with repositories that may be located on the internet or on another machine.
    -   `Remote`s can be repositories you contribute to, collaborate with, or simply synchronize your local repository with to stay up-to-date. Examples of popular `remote` hosting services include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

    -   When you add a `remote` repository to your local Git configuration, you give it a name. Common names include "origin," "upstream," "fork," or any other descriptive name you choose.

-   `Origin`:

    -   `Origin` is a specific name that is commonly used as the default `remote` repository name when you clone a repository or when you push to a repository. It's a convention, not a Git keyword.
    -   When you clone a repository from a `remote` location, Git sets up a `remote` called `origin` by default to point to the repository you cloned from. So, when you push changes, it knows where to send them.

-   `Master`

    -   The default branch name in Git is master. For both `remote` and local repository.

-   `Repository (Repo)`:

    -   A Git repository is a collection of files and directories along with the version history of those files.
    -   There are two types of repositories: local (on your computer) and `remote` (typically hosted on a server).

-   `Working Directory`:

    -   The working directory is the directory on your local machine where you edit, create, delete, and organize files.
    -   It contains the current state of your project.

-   `Staging Area (Index)`:

    -   The staging area, also known as the index, is an intermediate area where you prepare changes for the next commit.
    -   Files are added to the staging area using the git add command before they are committed to the repository.

-   `Commit`:

        -   A commit is a snapshot of the project's state at a particular point in time.
        -   Each commit has a unique identifier (a hash) and includes changes made to files since the last commit.
        -   Commits create a chronological history of your project.

-   `Branch`:

        -   A branch is a separate line of development within a Git repository.
        -   Branches allow multiple users to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without affecting each other's work.
        -   The default branch is usually called master or main.

-   `HEAD`:

    -   HEAD is a reference to the latest commit in the currently checked-out branch.
    -   It represents the snapshot of your project that is currently being worked on.

-   ``Remote` Repository`:

        -   A `remote` repository is a copy of your project hosted on a server or another machine.
        -   It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project.
        -   Common `remote` repository hosting services include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

-   `Clone`:

    -   Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a `remote` repository on your local machine.
    -   It sets up a connection between your local repository and the `remote` repository, enabling you to fetch and push changes.

-   `Pull`:

    -   Pulling refers to fetching changes from a `remote` repository and integrating them into your local branch.
    -   It combines the git fetch and git merge commands into a single operation.

-   `Push`:

    -   Pushing is the process of uploading your local commits to a `remote` repository.
    -   It makes your changes available to others and updates the `remote` repository's history.

-   `Merge`:

    -   Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.
    -   It is often used to integrate features or bug fixes from one branch into the main branch.

-   `Conflict`:

    -   A conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes because there are conflicting changes in the same part of a file.
    -   Conflicts must be manually resolved by the user before proceeding with the merge or commit.

-   `Pull Request (PR)`:

    -   A pull request is a feature commonly found on platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
    -   It allows developers to propose changes to a project and request that those changes be reviewed and merged into the main branch.

-   `Fork`:

    -   Forking is the process of creating a personal copy of a repository in which you can make changes without affecting the original repository.
    -   It's commonly used for contributing to open-source projects.

-   `Tag`:

    -   A tag is a reference to a specific commit.
    -   It is often used to mark significant milestones or releases in a project's history.

üî• NOTES:

-   There generally are at least three copies of a project on your workstation:

    -   One copy is your own repository with your own commit history (the already saved one, so to say).
    -   The second copy is your working copy where you are editing and building (not committed yet to your repo).
    -   The third copy is your local ‚Äúcached‚Äù copy of a `remote` repository (probably the original from where you cloned yours).

-   You cannot delete the branch you are on.
-   If you checkout a branch and then commits, the branch‚Äôs label autometically updates to the new commits.

## Initialize/Clone Git Repository

-   There are two methods to start a git projects:

    1. Cloning an Existing Repository from www.github.com using git command, (`$ git clone`)
    2. Initializing a Git Repository skeleton in the local machin using git command, (`$ git init`) then push it into a remote location such as `www.github.com` after establishing a link to the remote repository ,

-   `$ git clone https://github.com/repoName` ‚Üí It creates a repository named ‚ÄúrepoName‚Äù, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data from that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version.

-   [Undoing Commits & Changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes)
-   üî• [git checkout]()

    -   `$ git checkout <commit_id>`
    -   `$ git checkout master`
    -   `$ git checkout <file_name>` ‚Üí Discard the specified file from Working Area.
    -   `$ git checkout .` ‚Üí Discard all the changes to the Working Area.
    -   `$ git checkout <commit_id>`
    -   `$ git checkout -- <file> ...` ‚Üí to discard changes in working directory

-   üî• [git reset]()

    -   <span style="color:orange">How to discard committed files? Extra care should be given using the reset command?</span>

    -   `$ git reset` ‚Üí Removes all files from the staging area, but keeps the changes in your working directory. It effectively "unstages" all changes.
    -   `$ git reset HEAD <file_name>` ‚Üí Unstage the specified file from Staging Area.
    -   `$ git reset HEAD */.` ‚Üí Unstage all the file from Staging Area
    -   `$ git reset HEAD~1` ‚Üí Discard the LAST commit from Local Repository (Committing Area). Discarted file kept in Working Area
    -   `$ git reset HEAD~3` ‚Üí Discard the LAST THREE commit from Local Repository (Committing Area). Discarted file kept in Working Area
    -   `$ git reset --soft HEAD~3` ‚Üí Discard the first three commit from Local Repository (Committing Area). Discarted file kept in Staging Area
    -   `$ git reset --hard` ‚Üí COMPLETELY REMOVE EVERYTHING FROM LOCAL REPOSITORY (COMMITTING AREA) !!!!!!!!!!!!
    -   `$ git reset --hard HEAD~2`
    -   <font color="orange">How do I unstage changes?</font>
    -   `$ git restore .`
        -   It can be used to undo the effects of `git add` and unstage changes you have previously added to the Staging Area.
        -   It can also be used to discard local changes in a file, thereby restoring its last committed state.
    -   `$ git restore path/to/file/to/revert` ‚Üí Unstage the given file from Staging Area into Working Directory.
    -   `$ git clean -f` ‚Üí Remove untracked files from the working tree.
    -   `$ git rm --cached <file_name>` ‚Üí Unstage the specified file (`file_name`) from Staging Area.
    -   `$ git rm --cached *_initial.py` ‚Üí Unstage all the files name ended with `_initial.py` from Staging Area.
    -   `$ git rm -r --cached */migrations/` ‚Üí Unstage all (`migrations/*`) files recursively from Staging Area.
        -   NOTE: `--cached` option tells Git to only remove the folder from the Git repository's index (staging area) and not from the file system. The files in the folder will no longer be tracked by Git, but they will remain on your local disk.
    -   `$ git revert` ‚Üí it's better to use `git revert` to create a new commit that undoes the changes made in the previous commit.
    -   <span style="color:orange">How to remove a commit from remote repository:</span>
        1. git reset <commit_id>
        2. git push origin master -f

        -   `master` is master branch of local repository
        -   Pushes the master branch of local repository to master branch of remote repository.
    -   `$ git push -u origin master`
    -   `$ git push origin` ‚Üí push all the branches to origin
    -   `$ git fetch` is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original (yet doesn‚Äôt do any file transferring. It‚Äôs more like just checking to see if there are any changes available).
    -   `$ git pull` on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository.
    -   `$ git pull origin master`
        -   `origin` is master branch of remote repository
        -   `master` is master branch of local repository
        -   pulls the master branch of remote repository into master branch of local repository.
        -   It's equivalent to `$ git fetch origin && git merge origin master`
    -   `$ git pull upstream Master`
    -   `$ git fetch`
    -   `$ git fetch origin`
    -   `$ git fetch origin/master master`
