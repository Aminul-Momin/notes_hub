-   [Texas Learners Permit for Adults](https://virtualdriveoftexas.com/texas-learners-permit/)

First time adult drivers (have never held a drivers license before) 18 & over, but under the age of 25, must complete an approved adult driver education course Texas before apply for a learners permit. Our adult course includes the DPS written test, so you will not have to take the written test at the DPS office when applying.

Adults under 25 have two choices once they complete their online adult drivers ed course. Apply for a Texas learners permit, or instead, schedule the DPS road test. If you already know how to drive and are confident about taking the DPS road test, you can go ahead and schedule it. The DPS office is not going to ask how you learned to drive without a license. They will simply schedule your road test and after successfully complete it, you can apply for your Texas drivers license.

What If I Need To Practice?
If you do not have the driving experience necessary to pass the DPS road test, adults can request to be issued a Texas learners permit. With your permit, you can legally practice driving with a licensed adult over the age of 21 in the passenger seat, until you have the driving experience necessary to pass the DPS driving test.

For Texas adults over the age of 25, who are first time drivers, you are not alone. Itâ€™s really not uncommon to see this. In your case, the DPS does not require you to take a formal driver education course, however, it would be a tremendous advantage for you to enroll in our Adult driver course. Our adult course has the DPS written test in it, so this will save you at least one trip to your local DPS, but more importantly, it has the interactive training that will help you retain the driving knowledge you need in order to pass the written test.
