### Gitlab Terma & Concepts

-   `.gitlab-ci.yml`: The .gitlab-ci.yml file is a configuration file written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) that defines the structure and steps of the CI/CD pipeline. It resides in the root directory of your GitLab repository and provides a declarative way to specify the stages, jobs, and their associated scripts or commands.
-   `Pipeline`: A pipeline in GitLab CI/CD is a series of stages and jobs that define the tasks to be executed. Each pipeline is triggered by an event, such as a code push or a scheduled time. Pipelines provide a structured way to define and visualize the entire CI/CD process.
-   `Stage`: A stage represents a logical division within a pipeline. For example, a typical pipeline may consist of stages like "build," "test," and "deploy." Each stage contains one or more jobs.
-   `Job`: A job is a defined task within a stage. It represents a specific unit of work, such as compiling code, running tests, or deploying the application. Jobs are executed sequentially within their respective stages.
-   `Runner`: A runner is an agent that executes the jobs defined in a pipeline. Runners can be shared or specific to a project. They can run on different operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, or macOS. GitLab provides shared runners, but you can also set up your own custom runners.
-   `Artifacts`: Artifacts are files generated by a job and passed to subsequent stages or jobs within the pipeline. For example, a build job may produce an executable file that needs to be used in the deployment stage. Artifacts can be downloaded or used for archiving purposes.
-   `Runner Tags`: Runner tags are labels assigned to specific runners to indicate their capabilities or characteristics. For example, you can assign a runner with the tag "docker" to indicate that it can execute jobs within Docker containers. Tags are useful for assigning specific jobs to runners with specific capabilities.
-   `Triggers`: Triggers allow you to manually start a pipeline from an external source, such as an API call or a webhook. They provide a way to integrate with external systems or trigger pipelines from events outside of GitLab.
-   `Environments`: Environments in GitLab CI/CD represent different target environments where your application can be deployed, such as staging or production. Environments provide a way to define deployment-specific variables, control access, and view deployment statuses.
-   `GitLab CI/CD Variables`: Variables allow you to define and pass custom values to your CI/CD pipeline. They can be defined at the pipeline, stage, or job level and are useful for storing sensitive information, like API keys or environment-specific configurations.

### Github-Actions Terma & Concepts

-   `Workflow`: A workflow is an automated process defined in a YAML file (`.github/workflows/file_name.yml`) within your repository. It consists of one or more jobs, which are executed when triggered by specific events, such as pushes, pull requests, or scheduled intervals.
-   `Job`: A job represents a unit of work within a workflow. It contains a set of steps that define the tasks to be performed. Jobs run in parallel by default, but you can also configure them to run sequentially. Each job executes on a separate runner, which is a virtual machine or container where the job's steps are executed.
-   `Step`: A step is an individual task within a job. It can be a command, script, or an action. Steps are executed sequentially within a job and can include actions from the GitHub Marketplace, shell commands, or custom scripts.
-   `Action`: An action is a reusable unit of code that encapsulates a specific task. It can be created by you or obtained from the GitHub Marketplace, allowing you to extend the functionality of your workflows. Actions can be written in various languages and perform a wide range of tasks, such as building, testing, or deploying your code.
-   `Event`: An event triggers a workflow run. Events can include push events (when code is pushed to the repository), pull request events (when pull requests are opened, updated, or closed), scheduled events (triggered by a cron-like schedule), and more. You can configure workflows to respond to specific events based on your requirements.
-   `Runner`: A runner is a machine (virtual or physical) that executes jobs in a workflow. GitHub provides hosted runners that are maintained by GitHub, or you can set up self-hosted runners on your own infrastructure. Self-hosted runners give you more control and allow you to execute workflows on your own hardware or cloud environments.
-   `Artifact`: An artifact is a file or collection of files produced by a job. It can be saved for later use or passed to other jobs in the workflow. Artifacts are commonly used to share build outputs, test results, or deployment packages between different stages of the workflow.
-   `Environment`: An environment represents a target deployment environment, such as staging or production. GitHub Actions allows you to define environments and associate them with specific branches or workflows. Environments help you manage and control the deployment of your code to different stages.
-   `Secrets`: Secrets are encrypted variables that you can store in your repository or organization settings. They are used to securely store sensitive information, such as API keys, credentials, or access tokens, which can be used within your workflows. Secrets are encrypted and can only be accessed by selected workflows or actions.

### Jenkins Terms and Concepts

-   `Jenkinsfile`: A text file that defines the steps that need to be performed when a Jenkins Pipeline is run.
-   `Pipeline`: A pipeline in Jenkins is a series of jobs or stages that are chained together to create a complete software delivery process. Pipelines can include build, test, and deployment stages, and they can be designed to run automatically or in response to specific events.
-   `Job`: A job in Jenkins is a specific task that needs to be performed, such as building a project or running a test suite. Jobs can be configured to run automatically or on a schedule, or they can be triggered manually.
-   `Stage`: A logical unit of work in a Jenkins Pipeline.
-   `Build`: A build is the process of compiling and packaging the source code for a software project. In Jenkins, a build is triggered when a job is run, and it produces a set of output artifacts that can be used for testing or deployment.
-   `Build Types`: In Jenkins, there are several types of builds that you can configure based on your requirements. Here are two most commonly used build types in Jenkins.
    -   `Freestyle Build`: This is the most basic and flexible type of build in Jenkins. It allows you to define a series of build steps that can execute shell commands, run scripts, perform actions, or invoke external tools. Freestyle builds are highly customizable and suitable for various project types.
    -   `Pipeline Build`: Jenkins Pipeline is a powerful feature that allows you to define and manage your build process using a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL). Pipeline builds provide a way to define your build pipeline as code, allowing for better version control, repeatability, and advanced customization. Pipelines can have multiple stages, parallel execution, and integrate with source control systems.
-   `Jenkins Master`: In Jenkins, the term "Jenkins master" refers to the central component that manages the overall Jenkins automation server. The Jenkins master, also known as the "Jenkins controller" or "Jenkins server," is responsible for orchestrating and coordinating the execution of build jobs and workflows.
-   `Executor`: A slot/component for execution of work defined by a Pipeline or job on a Node. A Node may have zero or more Executors configured which corresponds to how many concurrent Jobs or Pipelines are able to execute on that Node. Executors are typically configured on agent machines, which can be physical or virtual machines, containers, or cloud instances. When a job is triggered in Jenkins, it is assigned to an available executor on a compatible agent. The executor then executes the job's tasks or steps, performing the build, test, or deployment actions specified in the job configuration. This allows for parallel execution of jobs, enabling faster builds and reducing overall execution time.
-   `Slave`/`Agent`: A slave in Jenkins is a machine or container that connects to a Jenkins controller, is used to distribute workload across multiple machines and executes tasks when directed by the controller. Slaves can be used to increase the capacity of a Jenkins server, or to run jobs on specific hardware or operating systems. There are two types of Agents.
    -   `Permanant Agent`: In Jenkins, a "permanent agent" refers to a long-running worker node or build agent that is permanently connected to the Jenkins master. Unlike ephemeral agents that are dynamically provisioned for each build and then terminated, permanent agents remain connected to the Jenkins master even when idle, ready to accept build tasks whenever assigned.
    -   `Cloud Agent`: In Jenkins, a "cloud agent" refers to a dynamic or ephemeral build agent that is provisioned on-demand in a cloud environment. Cloud agents are created as needed to execute build jobs and are terminated once the job is completed, allowing for efficient resource utilization and scalability. Docker is one of the most popular cloud agent of Jenkins besides Kubertetis and AWS Fleet Manager.
-   `Nodes`: Nodes are synonymous with agents or slaves in the Jenkins ecosystem. They can be physical machines, virtual machines, containers, or remote SSH connections. Nodes in Jenkins serve as execution environments for build jobs, providing the necessary resources and capabilities to run the jobs. The Jenkins master schedules and assigns build jobs to available nodes based on criteria such as workload, node availability, or specific job requirements.
-   `Trigger`: A trigger in Jenkins is an event that causes a job to run automatically. Triggers can be based on a schedule, a code commit, a build completion, or other events.
-   `Workspace`: A workspace in Jenkins is a directory on the file system that is used to store the source code and build artifacts for a job. Workspaces are created and managed automatically by Jenkins.
-   `Parameter`: A parameter in Jenkins is a value that is passed to a job at runtime. Parameters can be used to customize the behavior of a job, such as specifying the target environment for a deployment.
-   `Artifact`: An immutable file generated during a Build or Pipeline run which is archived onto the Jenkins Controller for later retrieval by users.
-   `Dashboard`: The Jenkins dashboard is the main interface for managing jobs, viewing build results, and configuring the system. The dashboard provides an overview of the current state of the Jenkins environment, and it can be customized to display specific information or widgets.
-   `Plugin`: A plugin is a software component that extends the functionality of Jenkins. Plugins can be used to add support for specific programming languages, testing frameworks, or deployment tools, among other things.

### What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source, continuous integration (CI) server that helps automate the software development process. It can be used to build, test, and deploy software projects. Jenkins is a popular CI server, and it is used by a wide range of organizations, from small startups to large enterprises. In short, Jenkins is an open-source powerful CI automation server that is used for building, testing, and deploying software.

-   Jenkins Features: Jenkins has a wide range of features, including:

    -   `Build automation`: Jenkins can be used to automate the build process for software projects. This can save time and effort, and it can help to ensure that the build process is repeatable and reliable.
    -   `Testing`: Jenkins can be used to automate the testing process for software projects. This can help to ensure that the software is working properly before it is deployed.
    -   `Deployment`: Jenkins can be used to deploy software projects to production. This can be done manually or automatically.
    -   `Notifications`: Jenkins can send notifications when builds, tests, or deployments succeed or fail. This can help to keep developers informed of the status of their projects.
    -   `Plugins`: Jenkins has a large number of plugins that can be used to extend its functionality. This includes plugins for building, testing, deploying, and managing software projects.

-   Jenkins Best Practices: There are a few best practices that you should follow when using Jenkins. These best practices can help you to get the most out of Jenkins and to avoid common problems.

    -   `Use a consistent naming convention for your jobs`:
        -   Using a consistent naming convention for your jobs will make it easier to find and manage your jobs. A good naming convention would include the name of the project, the build number, and the date.
    -   `Use a build tool`:
        -   Using a build tool can help you to automate the build process and to make it more reliable. A good build tool will allow you to define the steps that need to be performed when the project is built.
    -   `Configure notifications`:
        -   Configuring notifications will help you to stay informed of the status of your builds. You can configure Jenkins to send notifications when builds succeed or fail.
    -   `Use plugins`:
        -   Jenkins has a large number of plugins that can be used to extend its functionality. These plugins can be used to add new features to Jenkins or to improve the performance of Jenkins.

-   How to Use Jenkins

    -   To use Jenkins, you first need to install it on your computer. Once Jenkins is installed, you can create a new project. A project in Jenkins is a collection of jobs. A job in Jenkins is a unit of work that can be automated.
    -   To create a new job, you need to provide a name for the job and a description. You also need to select a build tool. Jenkins supports a wide range of build tools, including Ant, Maven, and Gradle.
    -   Once you have created a job, you can configure it. The configuration of a job includes the steps that need to be performed when the job is run. You can also configure the notifications that are sent when the job succeeds or fails.
    -   Once you have configured a job, you can run it. To run a job, you click the "Build Now" button. Jenkins will then start the build process.
    -   When the build process is complete, Jenkins will display the results of the build. The results of the build include the status of the build, the number of tests that passed, and the time it took to build the project.
