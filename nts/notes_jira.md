### Jira

Jira is a popular issue tracking and project management tool developed by Atlassian. It is widely used for tracking and managing tasks, projects, and software development processes. Here are some key terms and concepts in Jira:

-   `Issue`: In Jira, an "issue" represents a task, a bug, a user story, or any unit of work that needs to be tracked. Issues can be created, assigned, and tracked throughout their lifecycle.
-   `Project`: A "project" in Jira refers to a collection of issues and related information. It is used to organize and manage work within a specific area or team. Each project can have its own set of configurations, permissions, and workflows.
-   `Workflow`: A "workflow" defines the life cycle of an issue in Jira. It represents the different statuses or steps an issue goes through, from creation to completion. Workflows typically include states like "Open," "In Progress," "Resolved," and "Closed." They can be customized to match the specific processes and requirements of a project.
-   `Status`: A "status" represents the current position or stage of an issue within a workflow. It indicates the progress or state of an issue, such as "To Do," "In Progress," or "Done." Statuses can be customized to reflect the specific stages of work in a project.
-   `Issue Types`: Jira supports different "issue types" to classify and track various types of work. Common issue types include "Task," "Bug," "Story," "Epic," and "Sub-task." Each issue type can have its own set of fields, workflows, and configurations.
-   `Fields`: Jira uses "fields" to store and display information related to issues. Fields can represent attributes such as summary, description, assignee, priority, due date, and more. Jira provides a default set of fields, and you can also create custom fields to capture additional information specific to your project needs.
-   `Components`: "Components" allow you to categorize and organize issues within a project. They represent sub-sections or functional areas of a project. For example, a software project may have components like "Frontend," "Backend," or "Database."
-   `Boards`: Jira boards provide visual representations of issues based on different criteria. There are two main types of boards in Jira:
-   `Kanban Board`: A Kanban board provides a visual representation of the workflow for a project or team. It allows you to track and manage work in progress, visualize bottlenecks, and optimize the flow of work.
-   `Scrum Board`: A Scrum board is used to manage and visualize work in a Scrum framework. It typically includes columns representing different stages of the sprint, such as "To Do," "In Progress," "Testing," and "Done."
-   `Sprints`: Sprints are time-boxed iterations in Agile project management, specifically in Scrum. A "sprint" represents a fixed period during which a set of user stories or issues are planned, developed, and delivered. Sprints help in organizing and tracking work within a project.
-   `Agile Boards`: Jira Agile boards combine the functionality of Kanban and Scrum boards to manage Agile projects. Agile boards provide a visual representation of work, allowing teams to track and prioritize tasks, manage backlogs, and monitor progress using Agile methodologies.

### SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES

Software Development Approaches also known as software development methodologies or models, define the overall process and structure for developing software applications. Different approaches have evolved over time to address various project requirements, team dynamics, and development challenges. Here are some commonly used software development approaches:

-   `Waterfall Model`: The Waterfall model follows a linear, sequential approach to software development.
    It consists of distinct phases, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment, with each phase dependent on the completion of the previous one.
    Waterfall is characterized by its upfront planning, well-defined deliverables, and limited customer involvement during development.
    It is often suitable for projects with stable and well-understood requirements, where change is minimal or controlled.

-   `Agile`: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.
    It values adaptive planning, self-organizing teams, and iterative development cycles called sprints or iterations.
    Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP).
    Agile methodologies prioritize delivering working software in small increments, responding to change, and accommodating evolving requirements.
    Regular feedback, continuous improvement, and close collaboration with customers/stakeholders are integral to Agile.

-   `Scrum`: Scrum is a specific Agile framework that focuses on team collaboration, iterative development, and value delivery.
    It employs fixed-length iterations called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks, during which a potentially releasable product increment is developed.
    Scrum has defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospectives), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Burndown Chart) to support collaboration, transparency, and progress tracking.

-   `Kanban`: Kanban is an Agile approach that visualizes work as it flows through a process.
    It uses a Kanban board to visualize tasks/stories in different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
    Kanban emphasizes limiting work in progress (WIP) to maintain a smooth workflow and avoid bottlenecks.
    It provides a flexible approach, enabling teams to continuously adapt their work based on customer demand and team capacity.

-   `DevOps`: DevOps is a combination of development and operations, focusing on seamless collaboration between development and IT operations teams.
    It aims to automate software development processes, improve deployment frequency, and enhance overall software quality.
    DevOps emphasizes continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and close alignment between development and operations.

-   `Lean`: Lean software development draws inspiration from lean manufacturing principles.
    It focuses on eliminating waste, improving efficiency, and delivering value to customers.
    Lean emphasizes a culture of continuous improvement, fast feedback cycles, and reducing non-value-adding activities.

### SCRUM vs AGILE

Scrum and Agile are often discussed together as they are related concepts, but it's important to note that Scrum is just one specific framework within the broader Agile approach. Here's a comparison between Scrum and Agile:

-   `Agile`: Agile is a mindset or philosophy that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. It focuses on delivering value to customers through frequent iterations and continuous feedback. The core principles of Agile, as outlined in the Agile Manifesto, include valuing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Agile methodologies prioritize adaptability, customer satisfaction, and embracing change throughout the development process.
-   `Scrum`: Scrum is a specific Agile framework for managing and delivering complex projects. It provides a structured approach to software development that follows Agile principles. Scrum is characterized by its iterative and incremental development cycles called "sprints," which are time-boxed periods (typically 1-4 weeks). Scrum teams collaborate in short daily meetings called "Daily Scrums," plan and review work in "Sprint Planning" and "Sprint Review" meetings, and reflect on process improvements in "Sprint Retrospectives."

**Key Differences**:

-   Scope and Focus:

    -   Agile is a broader philosophy and mindset that can be applied to various domains beyond software development. It encompasses multiple methodologies and approaches.
    -   Scrum, on the other hand, is a specific framework within Agile that provides a defined set of roles, ceremonies, and artifacts specifically tailored for software development projects.

-   Structure and Roles:

    -   Agile does not prescribe specific roles, ceremonies, or artifacts. It allows for flexibility in adapting to the needs of the project and team.
    -   Scrum has well-defined roles, including the Scrum Master (facilitator and process enabler), Product Owner (represents the customer and prioritizes the backlog), and the Development Team (responsible for delivering the product increment).

-   Iterative Approach:

    -   Both Agile and Scrum follow an iterative approach, but Scrum employs fixed-length iterations called sprints. Each sprint produces a potentially shippable increment of the product.
    -   Agile methodologies may have different iteration lengths or may not necessarily follow fixed iterations. The focus is on delivering value through iterations and responding to customer feedback.

-   Ceremonies:

    -   Scrum has specific ceremonies, such as Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospectives, which provide structure and ensure regular communication and collaboration.
    -   Agile methodologies may have their own set of ceremonies or adapt the ceremonies based on project needs and team preferences.

-   Documentation:
    -   Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation. It emphasizes delivering functional software that meets customer needs.
    -   Scrum also emphasizes working software but includes specific artifacts like the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Burndown Chart to support transparency and progress tracking.
