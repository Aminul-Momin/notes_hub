-   [NoSQL Database Tutorial – Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh4gy1lbL2k&t=3220s)

### Terms and Concepts:

-   NoSQL (which stands for "not only SQL") is a broad term that refers to a class of databases that use a non-relational data model to store and retrieve data. While traditional relational databases use tables with fixed schemas and structured data, NoSQL databases allow for more flexible and dynamic data models, often using key-value pairs, document-based storage, or graph-based models.
-   NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to handle large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data that traditional relational databases struggle with. It offers many advantages over traditional relational databases, especially for modern applications that require high scalability, flexibility, and performance.

-   Here are some of the advantages of NoSQL databases:

    -   `Scalability`: NoSQL databases can easily scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the system, allowing them to handle massive amounts of data and high-traffic applications.
    -   `Flexibility`: NoSQL databases are designed to handle various types of data, including unstructured and semi-structured data, which makes them a better fit for modern applications.
    -   `Performance`: NoSQL databases can provide faster read and write speeds than traditional relational databases, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.
    -   `Cost-effective`: NoSQL databases are typically open source and free to use, which makes them a cost-effective solution for small and large businesses.
    -   `Availability`: NoSQL databases are designed to handle high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that applications continue to function even if one or more nodes fail.
    -   `Easy to use`: NoSQL databases are typically easier to set up and use than traditional relational databases, which require extensive schema design and management.
    -   `Cloud-native`: NoSQL databases are a good fit for cloud environments, as they can easily scale up and down as needed and are designed to work in distributed environments.

-   Key terms and concepts associated with NoSQL databases:

    -   `Document`: A NoSQL document is a data structure that can contain any number of fields, with each field having a name and a value. Documents are often used in document-based NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Couchbase.

    -   `Key-value store`: A key-value store is a NoSQL database that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and the associated value can be any data type. Key-value stores are often used for caching, session management, and real-time data processing.
    -   `Column family`: A column family is a grouping of related data in a NoSQL database that is stored as columns rather than rows. Column families are often used in column-based NoSQL databases such as Apache Cassandra.
    -   `Graph database`: A graph database is a NoSQL database that stores data in nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between those entities. Graph databases are often used for social networking, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.
    -   `CAP theorem`: The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, it is impossible to simultaneously provide more than two out of three guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strong consistency.

        -   `Consistency (C)`:

            -   In a distributed database system, consistency implies that all nodes in the system will have the same data view at the same time. When a write operation is performed and acknowledged to the client, all subsequent read operations from any node will return the most recent write.
            -   In other words, consistency ensures that the data is always up-to-date and consistent across all nodes.

        -   `Availability (A)`:

            -   Availability means that every request (read or write) to the database receives a response, without guaranteeing that it is the most up-to-date data. An available system doesn't necessarily provide the latest data but ensures that there is no downtime or unavailability in the system.
            -   It's important to note that "availability" in the CAP theorem refers to the ability of the system to respond to client requests, even if the response is based on potentially outdated data.

        -   `Partition Tolerance (P)`:

            -   Partition tolerance means that the database can continue to function even in the presence of network partitions or communication failures between nodes in a distributed system. Network partitions can occur due to network failures or delays, but the system should still operate without complete failure.
            -   Partition tolerance is essential for distributed systems because network issues are a common occurrence in real-world scenarios.

        -   The CAP theorem asserts that it's impossible to simultaneously achieve all three of these properties in a distributed database system. You can have any combination of two out of the three:

        -   `CA`: If you prioritize Consistency and Availability (CA), your database will provide strong consistency guarantees, but it may become unavailable in the presence of network partitions. Traditional relational databases often fall into this category.

        -   `CP`: If you prioritize Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CP), your database will ensure data consistency even in the face of network partitions, but this may come at the cost of availability during partition scenarios. Some distributed databases, like HBase, lean towards CP.

        -   `AP`: If you prioritize Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP), your database will always be available to respond to requests, even in the presence of network partitions, but it may not guarantee strong data consistency. Many NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra and Couchbase, aim for AP characteristics.

        -   It's important to understand that the CAP theorem is more of a guideline than a strict rule, and real-world distributed systems often make trade-offs based on specific use cases and requirements. The choice between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance depends on the application's needs and the desired trade-offs in a given distributed database system.

    -   `Sharding`: Sharding is the process of splitting a large dataset across multiple servers, or shards, to improve performance and scalability in a distributed system.
    -   `MapReduce`: MapReduce is a programming model used for processing large datasets in a distributed system, often used in conjunction with NoSQL databases to perform analytics and data processing.

### Different Types of NoSQL Databases:

NoSQL databases are a diverse group of database management systems that are designed to handle various types of data and use cases. Comparing different types of NoSQL databases can be challenging because each type is optimized for specific scenarios. Here, I'll provide an overview of the main types of NoSQL databases (document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph), highlighting their characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses:

-   `Document-Oriented Databases`:

    -   `Examples`: MongoDB, CouchDB, RavenDB
    -   `Data Model`: Store data in flexible, semi-structured documents (e.g., JSON, BSON, XML).
    -   `Strengths`:
        -   Schema flexibility allows for easy data evolution.
        -   Good for storing complex hierarchical data structures.

    -   `Strengths`:
        -   Optimized for high-volume data ingestion and time-based querying.
        -   Provides retention policies and downsampling capabilities.
        -   Ideal for monitoring, IoT, and analytics.
    -   `Weaknesses`:
        -   Less suitable for non-time-series data.
        -   May not support complex joins or transactions.
        -   Choosing the right NoSQL database depends on your specific requirements, including data structure, scalability needs, query complexity, and performance considerations. Many modern applications use a combination of different types of databases (polyglot persistence) to address various use cases within the same system.

Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database system designed for high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. It was originally developed at Facebook and is now maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. To understand Cassandra in gory detail, let's delve into some of its key terms and concepts:

-   `Distributed Database`: Cassandra is a distributed database system, which means it can span multiple nodes (machines) across different data centers. This distribution provides redundancy and high availability.
-   `Node`: In Cassandra, a node is a single instance of the database running on a machine. Nodes collectively form a cluster.
-   `Cluster`: A cluster in Cassandra is a group of nodes working together. Data is distributed across nodes in a cluster.
-   `Keyspace`: A keyspace is a top-level namespace in Cassandra, similar to a database in a relational database system. It defines data replication settings and is used to group related tables.
-   `Table`: Tables in Cassandra are similar to tables in a relational database but with a flexible schema. Each table consists of rows and columns, and each row is identified by a unique primary key.
-   `Column Family`: In earlier versions of Cassandra, data was organized into column families, but this concept has evolved. In modern versions, tables serve the purpose of column families.
-   `Column`: In Cassandra, a column is the basic unit of data storage. Columns are grouped into rows, and each column has a name, value, and a timestamp.
-   `Primary Key`: A primary key is used to uniquely identify rows within a table. In Cassandra, the primary key can consist of one or more columns.
-   `Partition Key`: The partition key is the first part of the primary key. It determines how data is distributed across nodes. All rows with the same partition key are stored together on the same node.
-   `Clustering Column`: Clustering columns are part of the primary key but are used to sort data within a partition. They determine the physical storage order of rows within a partition.
-   `Replication Factor`: Cassandra replicates data across multiple nodes for fault tolerance. The replication factor defines how many copies of data are maintained. It's set at the keyspace level.
-   `Consistency Level`: Cassandra allows you to configure the consistency level for read and write operations. Consistency levels determine how many nodes must acknowledge the operation for it to be considered successful.
-   `CAP Theorem`: Cassandra adheres to the CAP theorem, which states that in a distributed system, you can have at most two of the following three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Cassandra prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance over strict Consistency.
-   `Data Modeling`: Cassandra's data model is designed for query-intensive workloads. It's essential to model your data to fit the query patterns you expect.
-   `Tombstones`: Cassandra uses tombstones to mark data that has been deleted. These tombstones are eventually removed during compaction.
-   `Compaction`: Compaction is the process of merging and compacting SSTables (Sorted String Tables) to reduce disk space usage and improve read performance.
-   `CQL (Cassandra Query Language)`: CQL is a SQL-like query language used to interact with Cassandra databases. It provides commands for creating tables, inserting data, and querying data.
-   `Gossip Protocol`: Cassandra uses a gossip protocol for node discovery and cluster management. Nodes communicate with each other to share information about their status and the cluster's topology.
-   `Read Repair and Hinted Handoff`: Cassandra automatically handles read repair to ensure data consistency. Hinted handoff is a mechanism to temporarily store writes for unreachable nodes.
-   `Snitch`: A snitch in Cassandra is responsible for determining the location of nodes in the cluster, which helps in data replication and routing.
-   `Bloom Filters`: Bloom filters are used in Cassandra to quickly check if a particular row exists in a partition before performing a full read operation.
-   `Write Path and Read Path`: Cassandra's architecture includes distinct paths for write operations (commit log and memtable) and read operations (SSTables and cache).
-   Cassandra's architecture and concepts can be complex due to its distributed nature. It's crucial to carefully plan your data model and cluster configuration to meet your application's requirements for scalability and fault tolerance. Proper tuning and maintenance are also essential for optimal Cassandra performance.

-   `NoSQL Database`: MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it is not based on the traditional relational database model. Instead, it is designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and is known for its scalability and flexibility.
-   `Document Database`: MongoDB is a document-oriented database. Instead of tables with rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in documents. Documents are JSON-like objects with key-value pairs.
-   `Collection`: A collection in MongoDB is a group of related documents. Collections are similar to tables in a relational database but without a fixed schema. Documents within a collection can have different structures.
-   `Document`: A document is a basic unit of data in MongoDB. Documents are represented in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which allows for complex data types and nested structures.
-   `Field`: Fields are key-value pairs within a document. Each field has a name and a value, which can be of various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and subdocuments.
-   `ObjectId`: MongoDB automatically generates a unique ObjectId for each document by default. This ObjectId serves as a primary key for the document.
-   `Index`: MongoDB supports indexing for efficient querying. Indexes can be created on one or more fields to speed up searches.
-   `Query`: Queries in MongoDB are used to retrieve documents from a collection. You can use a query to filter documents based on specified criteria.
-   `CRUD Operations`: MongoDB supports the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for data manipulation. These operations are performed on documents within collections.
-   `Aggregation`: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data transformations, filtering, grouping, and calculations on the data.
-   `Replica Set`: A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data. It provides redundancy and high availability. One server is the primary, and others are secondary servers that replicate data from the primary.
-   `Sharding`: Sharding is a technique used to distribute data across multiple servers (shards) to achieve horizontal scalability. It allows MongoDB to handle large volumes of data and traffic.
-   `Mongod`: mongod is the primary MongoDB daemon that runs the database server. It handles data storage, retrieval, and query processing.
-   `Mongos`: mongos is a routing service used in sharded clusters to direct client requests to the appropriate shard servers.
-   `Wire Protocol`: MongoDB uses a binary protocol for communication between clients and the database server. This protocol allows efficient data exchange.
-   `Storage Engine`: MongoDB supports different storage engines, such as WiredTiger and MMAPv1, each with its own advantages and use cases. The storage engine is responsible for data storage and management.
-   `Transactions`: MongoDB introduced multi-document transactions in recent versions, allowing you to perform multiple operations within a single transaction, ensuring data consistency.
-   `Geospatial Indexing`: MongoDB supports geospatial queries, allowing you to store and query location-based data efficiently.
-   `Change Streams`: Change streams in MongoDB enable real-time notifications of data changes in a collection. This is useful for building reactive applications.
-   `Security`: MongoDB provides security features such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and auditing to protect your data and control access.
-   `Drivers and APIs`: MongoDB offers official and community-supported drivers and APIs for various programming languages, making it easy to interact with the database from your application.
-   `MQL (MongoDB Query Language)`: MongoDB has its query language, MQL, which is used to query and manipulate documents in the database.

Fault tolerance in the context of databases refers to the ability of a database system to continue operating reliably and provide uninterrupted service in the presence of hardware or software failures, errors, or unexpected events. The goal of achieving fault tolerance is to ensure that data remains accessible and consistent even when various types of failures occur. Here are some key aspects and strategies related to fault tolerance in databases:

-   `Redundancy`: - Redundancy involves duplicating critical components of the database to eliminate single points of failure. This can include duplicating servers, storage devices, or network connections.
    Redundancy helps ensure that if one component fails, another can take over seamlessly, reducing the risk of downtime or data loss.

-   `Data Replication`: - Data replication involves maintaining multiple copies of data on different servers or locations. These copies, or replicas, are kept synchronized to ensure data availability.
    Replication can be used to improve read performance, as clients can read from the nearest replica, and it provides fault tolerance by allowing failover to a replica if the primary server becomes unavailable.

-   `High Availability (HA)`: - High availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible with minimal downtime. In a database context, HA often involves redundant servers and automatic failover mechanisms.
    Cluster configurations, load balancers, and health monitoring are used to achieve high availability in databases.

-   `Automatic Failover`: - Automatic failover mechanisms are used to detect when a primary database server becomes unresponsive or fails. In such cases, a standby server is automatically promoted to the primary role.
    This ensures that database operations can continue without manual intervention even in the event of a server failure.

-   `Data Integrity`:

    -   Fault tolerance also includes mechanisms to maintain data integrity during failures. Techniques like write-ahead logging and transaction logs are used to ensure that changes to the database are recoverable in the event of a failure.

-   `Backup and Recovery`: - Regular backups of the database are essential for fault tolerance. Backups allow you to restore the database to a previous state in case of data corruption, accidental deletions, or catastrophic failures.
    Database systems often provide tools and procedures for performing automated and manual backups.

-   `Load Balancing`:

    -   Load balancing distributes incoming database queries and requests across multiple servers to ensure even utilization of resources. It can help prevent overloads and improve fault tolerance by redistributing workloads in case of server failures.

-   `Isolation`:

    -   Isolation techniques ensure that a failure or error in one part of the database system does not impact other parts. For example, isolating transaction processing can prevent cascading failures.

-   `Monitoring and Alerting`:

    -   Continuous monitoring of the database system for performance, health, and potential issues is crucial for fault tolerance. Alerts can notify administrators of abnormal conditions or failures.

-   `Disaster Recovery`:

    -   Disaster recovery planning involves preparing for catastrophic events, such as natural disasters or data center outages. It includes offsite backups, data replication to geographically distant locations, and recovery procedures.

-   `Consistency and Replication Models`:

    -   Databases may employ various replication models, such as synchronous or asynchronous replication, depending on the desired level of consistency and fault tolerance trade-offs.

-   Overall, fault tolerance in databases is a critical aspect of ensuring data availability and reliability, especially in mission-critical applications. Database administrators and engineers need to carefully design, configure, and maintain database systems to withstand various failure scenarios and minimize downtime.
