-   COMMAND DESCRIPTION SYNTAX:

    1. angle brackets for required parameters:
        - EX: `ping <hostname>`
    2. square brackets for optional parameters:
        - EX: `mkdir [-p] <dirname>`
    3. ellipses for repeated items:
        - EX: `cp <source1> [source2‚Ä¶] <dest>`
    4. vertical bars for choice of items:
        - EX: `netstat {-t|-u}`

-   COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT:

    -   A command-line argument or parameter is an item of information provided to a program when it is started. A program can have many command-line arguments that identify sources or destinations of information, or that alter the operation of the program.

-   COMMAND-LINE OPTION:

    -   A command-line option or simply option (also known as a flag or switch) modifies the operation of a command; the effect is determined by the command's program. Options follow the command name on the command line, separated by spaces. A space before the first option is not always required, such as Dir/? and DIR /? in DOS, which have the same effect[10] of listing the DIR command's available options, whereas dir --help (in many versions of Unix) does require the option to be preceded by at least one space (and is case-sensitive).

-   OPTION CONVENTIONS IN UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS:

    -   In Unix-like systems, the ASCII hyphen-minus begins options; the new (and GNU) convention is to use two hyphens then a word (e.g. --create) to identify the option's use while the old convention (and still available as an option for frequently-used options) is to use one hyphen then one letter (e.g., -c); if one hyphen is followed by two or more letters it may mean two options are being specified, or it may mean the second and subsequent letters are a parameter (such as filename or date) for the first option.

-   SSH (Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell): SSH is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.
-   SSH Clint:
-   SSH Agent:

-   **ssh-keygen:**

    -   `$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/<KEY_FILENAME> -C [USERNAME]` ‚Üí Generate a rsa key with file-name `KEY_FILENAME` and username `USERNAME`.
    -   `$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/<KEY_FILENAME> -P passphrase` ‚Üí Example 1: `$ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/file_name -t rsa -P ""`

-   **ssh-add:**

    -   `$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa` ‚Üí In order not to have prompted passphrase at login, cache the passphrase into 'ssh-agent' if you generate a key with passphrase.
    -   `alias sshadd='eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add'` ‚Üí Create alias to cache passphrase since `ssh-add` is temporary for a shell session.
    -   `$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa` ‚Üí Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain. The -K option is Apple's standard version of ssh-add, which stores the passphrase in your keychain for you when you add an ssh key to the ssh-agent. If you chose not to add a passphrase to your key, run the command without the -K option.
    -   `$ cat ~/.ssh/file_name.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
    -   `$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
    -   `$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` ‚Üí Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard in MacOS

    **ssh:**

    -   `$ ssh user@host` ‚Üí Connects to host as user
    -   `$ ssh -i .ssh/local_login_key.pub shah@10.0.0.4`
    -   `$ ssh shah@am2.local`
    -   `$ ssh farzana@am2.local`
    -   `$ ssh datanode1 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

    -   `$ scp file.txt username@to_host:/remote/directory/` ‚Üí Copy file from local host to a remote host

-   **ssh-copy-id:**

    -   `$ ssh-copy-id user@host` ‚Üí Adds your ssh key to host for user to enable a keyed or passwordless login
        -   `$ ssh-copy-id shah@10.0.0.4`

### File Permission

-   [chmod:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod)

    -   File permission system: `r=4,w=2,x=1` first, second, and third place of 3-digits representation for **Woner**, **Group**, and **Public** respectively

    -   `sudo chmod 664 <file_or_dir_name>`

        -   gives read and write previlage to User and Group and only read previlage to public.

    -   `sudo chmod g+w <file_or_dir_name>`

        -   add (`+`) write (`w`) privilege to group (`g`)

    -   `sudo chmod +x <file_name>`

        -   makes the file_name executible.

    -   `$ chmod 1755 findReslts.sh`
        -   sets sticky bit, sets read, write, and execute permissions for owner, and sets read and execute permissions for group and others (this suggests that the script be retained in memory)
    -   `$ chmod 4755 setCtrls.sh`
        -   sets UID, sets read, write, and execute permissions for user, and sets read and execute permissions for Group and Others
    -   `$ chmod 2755 setCtrls.sh`
        -   sets GID, sets read, write, and execute permissions for user, and sets read and execute permissions for Group and Others
    -   üî• `sudo chmod -R u+rwX,g-rwx,o-rx <file_or_dir_name>`
        -   Recursively adds (`+`) read (`r`), write (`w`), and special execution (`X`) permissions for user (`u`), and removes (`-`) read (`r`), write (`w`), and execution (`x`) permissions for Group (`g`), and removes (`-`) read (`r`) and execution (`x`) permissions for Others

-   [chown](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-chown-command/)
-   `$ chown [OPTIONS] USER[:GROUP] FILE(s)`

    -   EX: `$ sudo chown :group file`
    -   EX: `$ sudo chown :docker file1.txt`
        -   Change the group owner of file1.txt from linuxtechi to docker.

-   `$ chown -R www-data: /var/dir`

    -   Change the ownership of all files and subdirectories under the /var/dir directory to a new owner and group named www-data

-   `$ chown www-data: symlink1`
    -   Change the ownership of the file or directory the symlink points to
-   `$ chown -h www-data symlink1`

    -   Change the group ownership of the symlink itself, use the -h option.

-   [chgrp](https://linuxize.com/post/chgrp-command-in-linux/)
-   `$ chgrp [OPTIONS] GROUP FILE..`
    -   EX: `$ chgrp OPTION group_name /path/to/file_or_directory`
    -   The group_name attribute represents the new group name that the file or directory will acquire. Additionally, you can specify the GID (group ID) instead of the group name. In that case, you need to append the GID with a plus sign (+).
-   `$ chgrp -R www-data /var/www`

-   `$ chgrp www-data symlink1`
    -   If you try to change the group of the symbolic link symlink1 that points to /opt/file1, chgrp will change the ownership of the file or directory the symlink points to:
-   `$ chgrp -h www-data symlink1`
    -   To change the group ownership of the symlink itself, use the `-h` option
-   `$ chgrp -hR www-data /var/www`
    -   Change the group ownership recursively including symbolic links, pass the `-h` option

### Links

-   symbolic links (also known as ‚Äúsoft links‚Äù or ‚Äúsymlinks‚Äù): Refer to a symbolic path indicating the abstract location of another file.
-   hard links : Refer to the specific location of physical data.

-   `$ ln -s path/source_file_name.extn`
    -   Create a symlink from destination directory
-   `$ ln -s {absolute_path/source_filename} {absolute_path/symbolic_filename}`

### Netowrking

-   What the hell are a TCP and UDP ports?

    -   A port is nothing but a 16-bit number between 0 to 65535.
    -   For example, TCP port number 22 may be forwarded to the OpenSSH server. Therefore, 22 port number is a way to identify the sshd (OpenSSH server) process.

-   Port numbers
    -   The Well Known Ports are those from 0 through 1023.
    -   The Registered Ports are those from 1024 through 49151.
    -   The Dynamic and Private Ports are those from 49152 through 65535.
-   A registered port is a network port assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and stored in `/etc/services` file.

<details open><summary style="font-size:15px;color:red;">Systemd and Service Management</summary>

<details><summary style="font-size:15px;color:orange;">Terminology</summary>

-   **Systemd:**

    systemd is a software suite that provides an array of system components for Linux[6] operating systems. Its main aim is to unify service configuration and behavior across Linux distributions;[7] Its primary component is a "system and service manager"‚Äîan init system used to bootstrap user space and manage user processes. It also provides replacements for various daemons and utilities, including device management, login management, network connection management, and event logging.

-   **Core components and libraries**

    Following its integrated approach, systemd also provides replacements for various daemons and utilities, including the startup shell scripts, pm-utils, inetd, acpid, syslog, watchdog, cron and atd. systemd's core components include the following:

    -   `systemd` is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
    -   `systemctl` is a command to introspect and control the state of the systemd system and service manager. Not to be confused with sysctl.
    -   `systemd-analyze` may be used to determine system boot-up performance statistics and retrieve other state and tracing information from the system and service manager.

    Beside its primary purpose of providing a Linux init system, the systemd suite can provide additional functionality, including the following components:

    -   `journald`
        `systemd-journald` is a daemon responsible for event logging, with append-only binary files serving as its logfiles. The system administrator may choose whether to log system events with systemd-journald, syslog-ng or rsyslog. The potential for corruption of the binary format has led to much heated debate.
        Journalctl is a utility for querying and displaying logs from journald, systemd‚Äôs logging service. Since journald stores log data in a binary format instead of a plaintext format, journalctl is the standard way of reading log messages processed by journald.

-   **Configuration of systemd**

    -   systemd records initialization instructions for each daemon in a configuration file (referred to as a "unit file") that uses a declarative language, replacing the traditionally used per-daemon startup shell scripts. The syntax of the language is inspired by .ini files.
    -   Unit-file types include:
    -   .service
    -   .socket
    -   .device (automatically initiated by systemd)
    -   .mount
    -   .automount
    -   .swap
    -   .target
    -   .path
    -   .timer (which can be used as a cron-like job scheduler)
    -   .snapshot
    -   .slice (used to group and manage processes and resources)
    -   .scope (used to group worker processes, isn't intended to be configured via unit files[69])

</details>

**systemctl**

-   [How to Use Systemctl Utility in Linux](https://linuxhint.com/systemctl-utility-linux/)
-   `$ sudo systemctl list-units`
-   `$ sudo systemctl list-units --type=service`
-   `$ sudo systemctl list-units ‚Äìstate=inactive`
-   `$ sudo systemctl cat docker` ‚Üí show the contents of the Docker unit
-   `$ sudo systemctl edit docker` ‚Üí The command will launch the nano text editor, allowing you to edit the unit file specified.
-   `$ `
-   `$ `
-   `$ sudo systemctl status sshd`
-   `$ sudo systemctl start nginx`
-   `$ sudo systemctl stop nginx`
-   `$ sudo systemctl reload nginx` ‚Üí Reloading a service works by stopping the worker processes, apply configuration changes and restart the worker processes. That does not shut down the actual service itself.
-   `$ sudo systemctl restart nginx` ‚Üí restarting will shut down the service and the worker processes and restart them.
-   `$ sudo systemctl enable nginx`
-   `$ sudo systemctl enable nginx --now`
-   `$ sudo systemctl disable sshd`
-   `$ `
-   `$ `

**journalctl**

-   [Using journalctl](https://www.loggly.com/ultimate-guide/using-journalctl/)

-   `$ `
-   `$ journalctl --since "1 hour ago"`
-   `$ journalctl --since "2015-06-26 23:15:00" --until "2015-06-26 23:20:00"`
-   `$ journalctl -u nginx.service`
-   `$ journalctl -u mysql.service -f` ‚Üí ‚Äúfollows‚Äù the mysql service log.
-   `$ journalctl -u apache2.service -r -o json-pretty` ‚Üí The -o parameter enables us to format the output of journalctl query.

### COMMAND-LINE PROCESSING CYCLE

---

The default order for command lookup is functions, followed by built-ins, with scripts and executables last.
There are three built-ins that you can use to override this order: `command`, `builtin` and `enable`.

---

-   command # removes alias and function lookup. Only built-ins and commands found in the search path are executed
-   builtin # looks up only built-in commands, ignoring functions and commands found in PATH
-   enable # enables and disables shell built-ins

-   eval # takes arguments and run them through the command-line processing steps all over again

### PROCESS HANDLING

-   To suspend a job, type `CTRL+Z` while it is running. You can also suspend a job with `CTRL+Y`.
-   This is slightly different from `CTRL+Z` in that the process is only stopped when it attempts to read input from terminal.
-   Of course, to interrupt a job, type `CTRL+C`.

### DEBUGGING SHELL PROGRAMS

```bash
bash -n scriptname  # don't run commands; check for syntax errors only
set -o noexec       # alternative (set option in script)

bash -v scriptname  # echo commands before running them

### The Linux Kernel

Every operating system (OS) has a kernel. The kernel is the layer of the OS that bridges the hardware with the main programs that run on a computer. The kernel is the core of the OS and is the first to load when the computer boots up. It remains in the computer's memory throughout a session. It is responsible for providing an interface for all applications, controlling the hardware and allowing processes to get information from each other. There are three types of kernel:

-   Microkernel
-   Hybrid
-   Monolithic

Linux uses a monolithic kernel, so called because it includes device drivers and the file management system and therefore requires more memory. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a microkernel aims to occupy the smallest amount of memory by managing only the necessities such as the CPU, memory and inter-process communication (IPC).

### The Shell

The shell forms the layer between the user and the kernel so the user can enter commands. The kernel 'understands' only binary language, which is composed exclusively of ones and zeros. In early computing, any instructions/commands from the users were entered in binary language, but this evolved so that the user can enter commands in a more recognizable language. It is the shell that acts as the go-between, accepting the commands entered in the language recognizable by the user, and translating them to binary language for the kernel.

### Bash

Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell, and is **a type of shell** found in Linux, which is the default shell in several versions ('distributions') of Linux. Other common types of shell are cshell and kshell, though there are others. The most primitive type of shell in Linux is sh.

### Terminal

The terminal is the application that brings it all together, in the sense that it provides a visual representation of the shell for the user to enter commands. In other words, in a GUI (graphical user interface), where applications and other features are visually represented by images that the user can manipulate by clicking on them with a cursor, a terminal application opens a window where the user can type in commands for the shell to interpret into binary language for the kernel.

Summing it all up, we could say that we've discussed three layers so far: the terminal, where the user enters written commands; the shell, and Bash being a type of shell, which takes those commands and interprets them into binary language; the kernel which takes the binary language commands and executes the task on hand.

### Elements of Bash:

-   [Pipeline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html#Pipelines):

    -   A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators `|` or `|&`

-   [Array in Bash](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html#Arrays):

-   [Grouping Commands](https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-brackets.html):

-   [Shell Expansion](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html#Shell-Expansions): Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into tokens. There are seven kinds of expansion performed:
    -   **Brace Expansion** $‚Üí$ Expansion of expressions within braces.
    -   **Tilde Expansion** $‚Üí$ Expansion of the ~ character.
    -   [Shell Parameter Expansion](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion) $‚Üí$ How Bash expands variables to their values.
    -   **Command Substitution** $‚Üí$ Using the output of a command as an argument.
    -   **Arithmetic Expansion** $‚Üí$ How to use arithmetic in shell expansions.
    -   **Process Substitution** $‚Üí$ A way to write and read to and from a command.
    -   **Word Splitting** $‚Üí$ How the results of expansion are split into separate arguments.
    -   **Filename Expansion** $‚Üí$ A shorthand for specifying filenames matching patterns.

### Flags/Options in Bash:

-   [Taking command line arguments using flags in bash](https://dev.to/shriaas2898/taking-command-line-arguments-using-flags-in-bash-121)
-   [Different ways to implement flags in bash](https://jonalmeida.com/posts/2013/05/26/different-ways-to-implement-flags-in-bash/)
-

### Special Variables in Bash:

-   [Shell Parameters](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html#Shell-Parameters)

-   `$0` $‚Üí$ The filename of the current script.
-   `$n` $‚Üí$ The Nth argument passed to script was invoked or function was called.
-   `$#` $‚Üí$ The number of argument passed to script or function.
-   `$@` $‚Üí$ All arguments passed to script or function.
-   `$*` $‚Üí$ All arguments passed to script or function.
-   `$?` $‚Üí$ The exit status of the last command executed.
-   `$$` $‚Üí$ The process ID of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.
-   `$!` $‚Üí$ The process number of the last background command.
-   `$IFS`$‚Üí$

### Shell command separator/control characters:

### Functions in Bash:

### FUNCTIONS

```bash
# The function refers to passed arguments by position (as if they were positional parameters), that is, $1, $2, and so forth.
# $@ is equal to "$1" "$2"... "$N", where N is the number of positional parameters. $# holds the number of positional parameters.


function functname() {
    shell commands
}

unset -f functname  # deletes a function definition
declare -f          # displays all defined functions in your login session
```

### FLOW CONTROLS

statement1 && statement2 # and operator
statement1 || statement2 # or operator

-a # and operator inside a test conditional expression
-o # or operator inside a test conditional expression

### Some Discovered Errors:

```bash
# Brace Expension errors !
PATHS="$SD"/WORKSPACE_SETUP/.{git-aliases.bash,git-completion.bash,git-prompt.sh}

# Error
PATHS="$SD/WORKSPACE_SETUP.git-aliases.bash $SD/WORKSPACE_SETUP.git-completion.bash $SD/WORKSPACE_SETUP.git-prompt.sh"

```

### Control Flow in Bash:

-   **Remarks:**

    -   contition is written in square brackets.
    -   when use mathematical operator in conditions or elsewhere use double parenthesis.

```bash
if [ expr1 ]; then
    statments ...
elif [ expr2 ]; then
    statments ...
elif [ expr3 ]; then
    statments ...
else
    statments ...
fi


if [ ! -f "$2" ]
then
  echo "File \"$2\" does not exist."
  exit $E_NOFILE
fi
```

### Looping in Bash:

-   **Remarks:**

#### for:

##### Operating on a file list contained in a variable

```bash

#!/bin/bash
# fileinfo.sh

FILES="/usr/sbin/accept
/usr/sbin/pwck
/usr/sbin/chroot
/usr/bin/fakefile
/sbin/badblocks
/sbin/ypbind"     # List of files you are curious about.
                  # Threw in a dummy file, /usr/bin/fakefile.

echo

for file in $FILES
do

  if [ ! -e "$file" ]       # Check if file exists.
  then
    echo "$file does not exist."; echo
    continue                # On to next.
   fi

  ls -l $file | awk '{ print $8 "         file size: " $5 }'  # Print 2 fields.
  whatis `basename $file`   # File info.
  # Note that the whatis database needs to have been set up for this to work.
  # To do this, as root run /usr/bin/makewhatis.
  echo
done

exit 0


```

##### Find a particular string in the binaries in a specified directory.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# findstring.sh:

directory=/usr/bin/
fstring="Free Software Foundation"  # See which files come from the FSF.

for file in $( find $directory -type f -name '*' | sort )
do
  strings -f $file | grep "$fstring" | sed -e "s%$directory%%"
  #  In the "sed" expression,
  #+ it is necessary to substitute for the normal "/" delimiter
  #+ because "/" happens to be one of the characters filtered out.
  #  Failure to do so gives an error message. (Try it.)
done

exit $?

#  Exercise (easy):
#  ---------------
#  Convert this script to take command-line parameters
#+ for $directory and $fstring.
```

##### Symbolic links in a directory, saved to a file

```bash

#!/bin/bash
# symlinks.sh: Lists symbolic links in a directory.

OUTFILE=symlinks.list                         # save-file

directory=${1-`pwd`}
#  Defaults to current working directory,
#+ if not otherwise specified.


echo "symbolic links in directory \"$directory\"" > "$OUTFILE"
echo "---------------------------" >> "$OUTFILE"

for file in "$( find $directory -type l )"    # -type l = symbolic links
do
  echo "$file"
done | sort >> "$OUTFILE"                     # stdout of loop
#           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^                       redirected to save file.

# echo "Output file = $OUTFILE"

exit $?
```

##### Nested Loop

```bash

#!/bin/bash
# nested-loop.sh: Nested "for" loops.

outer=1             # Set outer loop counter.

# Beginning of outer loop.
for a in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo "Pass $outer in outer loop."
  echo "---------------------"
  inner=1           # Reset inner loop counter.

  # ===============================================
  # Beginning of inner loop.
  for b in 1 2 3 4 5
  do
    echo "Pass $inner in inner loop."
    let "inner+=1"  # Increment inner loop counter.
  done
  # End of inner loop.
  # ===============================================

  let "outer+=1"    # Increment outer loop counter.
  echo              # Space between output blocks in pass of outer loop.
done
# End of outer loop.

exit 0
```

```bash
# Process each file in directory_1, comparing it to directory_2
missing=0
for filename in "$1"/*; do
    fn=$(basename "$filename")
    if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
        if [ ! -f "$2/$fn" ]; then
            echo "$fn is missing from $2"
            missing=$((missing + 1))
        fi
    fi
done
echo "$missing files missing"
```

##### Various ways of geting list of files's path

```bash
for entry in `ls $search_dir`; do
    echo $entry
done

for entry in "$search_dir"/* "$work_dir"/*
do
  if [ -f "$entry" ];then
    echo "$entry"
  fi
done

$ pwd
/home/victoria

$ find $(pwd) -maxdepth 1 -type f -not -path '*/\.*' | sort
/home/victoria/new
/home/victoria/new1
/home/victoria/new2
/home/victoria/new3
/home/victoria/new3.md
/home/victoria/new.md
/home/victoria/package.json
/home/victoria/Untitled Document 1
/home/victoria/Untitled Document 2

$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -not -path '*/\.*' | sed 's/^\.\///g' | sort
new
new1
new2
new3
new3.md
new.md
package.json
Untitled Document 1
Untitled Document 2
```

-   `.` : current folder
-   remove `-maxdepth 1` to search recursively
-   `-type f `: find files, not directories (`d`)
-   `-not -path '*/\.*'` : do not return `.hidden_files`
-   `sed 's/^\.\///g'` : remove the prepended `./` from the result list

#### while:

##### While loop with multiple conditions

```bash
var1=unset
previous=$var1

while echo "previous-variable = $previous"
      echo
      previous=$var1
      [ "$var1" != end ] # Keeps track of what $var1 was previously.
      # Four conditions on *while*, but only the final one controls loop.
      # The *last* exit status is the one that counts.
do
echo "Input variable #1 (end to exit) "
  read var1
  echo "variable #1 = $var1"
done

# Try to figure out how this all works.
# It's a wee bit tricky.

exit 0
```

##### Inside its test brackets, a while loop can call a function.

```bash
t=0

condition ()
{
  ((t++))

  if [ $t -lt 5 ]
  then
    return 0  # true
  else
    return 1  # false
  fi
}

while condition
#     ^^^^^^^^^
#     Function call -- four loop iterations.
do
  echo "Still going: t = $t"
done

# Still going: t = 1
# Still going: t = 2
# Still going: t = 3
# Still going: t = 4
```

```bash
number=0
while [ "$number" -lt 10 ]; do
    echo "Number = $number"
    number=$((number + 1))
done
```
